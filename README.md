# C Projects:

These are the projects that i have written in C programming language. Most of them are from the exercises of **The C Programming Language** by **Brian Kernighan & Dennis Richie**.

## Description:

The projects do as their names suggest. Plus, Every step of code is explained with comments.
I wrote these projects while learning to code and to develop my logical thinking skills.

## How to Download them?

At the top right corner above the files there's a green button with **Code** written on it. Click on it and copy the url that shows up in the dropdown bar.
Then you can clone the directory onto your computer using the command :

    > $ git clone copied_url

After the directory is successfully cloned, you'll need to download a compiler to compile the code into executable files before running them. For that, you can download **mingw** compiler compatible for your desktop. 

In the terminal:

+ To compile the code. Use the command:

        > gcc file_name -o executable_file_name

+ And then to run it. Use the command:

        > gcc ./executable_file_name
